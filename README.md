# Project Summary
For this project, I worked on a Superstore Sales dataset and executed 25 SQL queries to extract meaningful business insights. The project involved applying a wide range of SQL concepts and techniques to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and overall business trends.
I utilized filtering with WHERE, grouping data with GROUP BY and HAVING, and also implemented a self-join to answer more complex questions. Additionally, I applied aggregate functions such as SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), and MAX() to summarize key metrics like total revenue, average sales, and highest-selling products and categories.

# Conclusion
This project helped me gain practical experience in data analysis using SQL. It showed how structured queries can turn raw sales data into clear, decision-ready insights. It also improved my ability to write clean, efficient queries for both simple lookups and deeper business analysis. Every query provided a new perspective on how structured data can reveal business trends, such as high-profit cities, underperforming states, or customer behavior across regions.
